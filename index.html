<p>This website is a blog containing my personal thoughts and ideas on combatting modern slavery. I became involved in this fight in 2015 and I’ve been involved in various projects since then. So I thought it was about time I shared some of my insights - hopefully they are useful. I love meeting and chatting with new people, so if you find any of these articles interesting or useful then let me know!</p>

<p>My career has mostly been in the private sector. I’ve spent about 20 years working as a technologist on IT systems and services for large government departments and for-profit companies. I found it fascinating because information technology threads its way throughout organisations. As a career technologist you must quickly understand the mechanics of how a business functions because technology enables most of their important processes.</p>

<p>Technology has also become the cornerstone of many new business models over the last few decades. Technology such as cloud services and mobile devices are tools that have enabled businesses to scale quickly, utilising clever network effects and incentive structures. Why is this relevant? Well, the world of slavery and human trafficking uses many of the same business techniques. Trafficking is formed around supply and demand. Traffickers confront logistical challenges; they use clever marketing techniques; they know the finance models that make trafficking profitable. Criminals are experts in sourcing their “product”, reacting to risk, and meeting client demands. It’s an industry. After a career spent trying to grow industries, it’s been a jolt to suddenly start developing strategies to tear one down.</p>

<p>Over the last few years I’ve worked pro-bono with amazing organisations and collaborations at local, national and international contexts - mainly in Asia and Europe. This has provided me with a better understanding of the issue, although it has also made me realise how little I understand. Modern slavery is deceptive. It’s a complex problem.</p>

<p>My passion to fight human trafficking stems from enragement at the human tragedy as well as a deep frustration that our collective response has generally been inadequate. My background has mainly been focussed on strategy and technology, so there will sometimes be a focus on this  within the articles. I will hopefully reinforce what I think we are doing well and also openly challenge what I think needs to change. I will write about new ideas I’ve had (some of which are probably correctly categorised as “moonshots”). I will also write hints and tips for organisations looking to utilise technology to disrupt trafficking.</p>

<p>As a reminder, these articles will be my personal thoughts and do not represent any organisation I work with.</p>
